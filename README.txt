EXECUTION:

To execute our application on a CCIS Linux Machine, change into the directory
that holds this application's executable file and execute one of the following commands:

    $ ./dan -f <path> -f <path>
    $ ./dan -f <path> -d <path>
    $ ./dan -d <path> -f <path>
    $ ./dan -d <path> -d <path>

<path> is a linux path name for a file or directory within the CCIS shared network.

If "-f" precedes a <path>, then the <path> must be a resource file that is in WAVE format. 
If "-d" precedes a <path>, then the <path> must file directory path which leads to a base 
resource file that is in WAVE format.
